# Getting Started


## Cable Management

### Over-Under

The principle of Over-Under is to counteract the "coil" that inherently occurs when wrapping a cable. There are various styles of this, including "[figure eight](#figure-eight)" wrapping.

1. Hold an end of the cable in your left hand, the end facing away from you.
2. With your right hand, **palm down**, grab the cable about 24" down the cable's tail (the circumference of your wrap).
3. Bring your right hand to meet your left hand creating a coil.
  * Your left hand should take hold of this coil allowing your right hand to create another.
  * **Pro-tip:** using your index and thumb you can twist the cable as you pull it up to help the coil lay perfectly.
4. With your right hand, **palm upwards**, grab the cable about 24" down the cable's tail.
5. Bring your right hand to meet your left hand, twisting your wrist inward to make your hand palm/fist down. The coil you just made should be "under" the start of the coil.
  * This is hard to describe but when you see it, you'll get it.
  * This step "undoes" the "twist" created in the previous coil enabling the cable to unravel straight.
  * **Pro-tip:** as before, using your index finger and thumb to twist the cable allowing it to lay perfectly.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 until complete.

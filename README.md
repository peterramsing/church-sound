# Docs for Church Sound Engineers and Techs

I've been doing sound since I was six and have needed to get my head around all the knowledge I've been taught and learned. Here's that attempt. Feel free to make updates, requests, etc.

**This is very much a Work In Progress right now!**


### Roles
It's important for everyone to stay on the same page. Ensuring that people know what they are responsible for is extremely helpful.

### Lexicon (or terminology)
Staying in sync with your team is important. Keeping lexicon/terminology straight can help!

* [Lexicon](docs/lexicon.md)

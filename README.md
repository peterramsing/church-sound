# Docs for Church Sound Engineers and Techs

I've been doing sound since I was six and have needed to get my head around all the knowledge I've been taught and learned. Here's that attempt. Feel free to make updates, requests, etc.

This is to be a jumping off point and not a law book. While this might be what I use for my teams this is just to spark conversations to create your own plans.

**This is very much a Work In Progress right now!**

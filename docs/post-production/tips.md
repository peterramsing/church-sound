## Recording

### Keeping Time
Start your recording on the hour so that you can make notes based on the time of day for going back and editing more easily.

## Monitors

### Don't just do what they ask
This one is a bit devious but very important nonetheless. When you're asked for things from musicians pause and ask yourself "what are they really asking?". Here's an example:

> You're asked by a vocalist to turn up their voice in a mix containing the vocalist and a guitar.

What are they asking: **Turn me up!**
What they actually want: **I'd like to not strain as much to here my vocal over the guitarist.**

What they tell you to do: **Turn me up!**
What you should do: **Turn the guitar down so they don't have to focus as hard to hear their vocal while helping reduce stage volume**

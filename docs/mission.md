# The Mission Of the Sound Team

[Back Home](/README.md)

*To be finalized still...*

To create an environment that empowers the worship team to engage more deeply in leading the church towards more personal worship, and clarity and distraction free teaching.

1. Give praise to God through musical, **sound engineering**, and serving. Everything you do should be for empowering others to enter into a spirit of praise.
2. Support the worship team and empower them to play, sing, and worship their best.
3. Ensure that the congregation feels welcomed and comfortable.


*Why should the musicians come before the congregation? For example, if you vocalist want more volume in their monitor then you should do your best to give it to them even if the increased stage volume will require you to turn up the master volume. Nobody likes a grumpy vocalist but people will generally still be able to worship if it's a bit louder. This is, however, where you need to be clever and work for the overall goal of giving praise to God. If the musician's request is absurd...you get the point.*

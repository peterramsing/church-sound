# Subtractive Mixing
*A philosophy for mixing*

## Overview
Subtractive mixing allows for the engineer to remain in control of the volume while still being able to fine tune the mix.

## What Subtractive Mixing Is Not
Often when mixing if you can't hear the guitar in the mix, you turn it up. That makes sense. Subtractive Mixing, however, is the process where instead of turning up the guitar you instead ask "what is louder than the guitar that is getting in the way?". **Subtractive Mixing is not turning up channels but instead turning down what is in conflict.**
